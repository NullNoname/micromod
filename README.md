# IBXM alpha 51
This is an unofficial mirror of IBXM alpha 51, the version bundled with [Paulscode 3D Sound System](http://www.paulscode.com/forum/index.php?topic=4.0)'s IBXM codec.

This is *techinically* a fork of the original IBXM author Martin Cameron's [official Git repository](https://github.com/martincameron/micromod), though proper commit history is unavailable because this version of IBXM was released before he created the said repository.

I've added pom.xml for Maven build. To build, simply use `mvn package` on the root directory.
